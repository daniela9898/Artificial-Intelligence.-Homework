Lab4_Cuza_Daniela.ipynb -> Will a patient have a 10 year risk of developing a cardio vascular diseases?
The framingham.csv file contains medical data from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, who participated in cardiovascular disease prevention trials. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The set contains 15 attributes that combine the sociological and medical characteristics of the respondents, such as age, gender, body mass index, blood sugar concentration and others. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. It is necessary to make a classifier that can predict the occurrence of heart problems based on these data. Information on the occurrence of subjects' heart problems was recorded at the level of the TenYearCHD attribute.

Lab5_Cuza_Daniela.ipynb -> CNNs and Autoencoders
In this assignment we will first train a CNN for the classification problem and then an autoencoderencoder that learns representations of images of the fashion_mnist dataset. Finally, you will create a simple image retrieval system by using the trained autoencoder and the nearest-neighbors algorithm.
